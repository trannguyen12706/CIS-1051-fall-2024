I didn't add sound effects to my video game.


I added the jump setting for my character but didn't add an
obstacle for my character to jump over yet(the lava hole
I mentioned in the proposal)


Although my character can jump it can't jump while i hold down
the left or right keyboard; can only do it separately, not at the same time.
