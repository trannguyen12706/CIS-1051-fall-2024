# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Dinosaur Survival

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A video game

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The video game will be about a dinosaur trying to avoid the lavas falling from the sky to survive

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Use the left and right keys to move the dinosaur left and right to avoid the lavas

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Add some lava pools on the ground, and make the dinosaur jump over them to avoid falling in

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadlinAdd some sound effects to it

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For this project, I need to learn more skills such as creating backgrounds, graphics, characters for video games. Making the obstacles move and have an impact on the character. Loading and controlling audio files for sound effects. I will need to research more on the topic of how a video game works, how to create backgrounds, characters and obstacles for the game. As well as how to add sound effects.
